This course has two types of assignments:

*   [A literature critique](#critique), in the form of a paper and in-class presentation
*   [Six problem sets](#problem) that support the term project.

{{< anchor "critique" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Literature Critique
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Purpose

The purpose of the paper review and presentations are to:

1.  Extend the course knowledge to topics beyond the scope of this class
2.  Provide you with an experience which will help to prepare you to
3.  Assess how well you can apply the course design and analysis principles to problems beyond the scope of the project and examples covered in class.
4.  Have Fun!!! This is not mean to stress you, we want to see if you can look at a cool technology and assess its importance/worth.

### Grading Merits

1.  How well you identify the scholarly merit and potential for broad impact
2.  Quality of summary of the work and appropriate prior art/work
3.  Presentation style (not necessary to dress up, but delivery should be professional, though appropriate humor is always welcome)
4.  Your ability to handle questions on application of the work to MuSS engineering
5.  Meeting the time constraints
6.  Quality of the questions which you (as a member of the audience) ask of other presenting groups
7.  Part of your grade will come from Faculty assessment and part from student assessment

### Logistics

*   Each group is supposed to present two paper reviews during the last two weeks of this course. Ok
*   Group of 4 is supposed to review 2 papers (one from the paper pool 1, one from the paper pool 2), while group of 5 is to review 3 papers. Groups of 5 may pick the 3rd paper from either pools 1 or 2, depending upon availability.
*   Paper pool 1 will be provided by Prof. Culpepper and pool 2 by Prof. Kim.
*   Paper pools will be posted on the course web. (apprx. one month before the presentation). The number of each paper pools will be greater than the number of groups (at least +3), to insure enough choice left for the last group to pick.
*   It will be FCFS (first come, first served) when to pick papers from the paper pools.
*   Each day of the class with no lecture (e.g. the meeting and design days), the class will meet at the lecture room, and have one group presentation at the beginning of each day. It will be 10 minutes for each paper.
    *   4 minutes review (by the first student)
    *   4 minutes critics (by the second speaker)
    *   2 minutes summary/questions (by faculty)
    *   A few minutes questions from fellow students.
*   This paper review will make 20% of the grade (as a team 10%, as an individual 10%).
*   A 3 page summary paper is no longer required. This was the original plan outlined in the first lecture

{{< anchor "problem" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Problem Sets
---------------------------------------------------

Each problem set of the term project is a 1- 2 page of design summary of your important decisions/modeling/progress to date. We would expect to see detailed sketches, major equations and plots which demonstrate that you are on the right track.  A short discussion of risks/mitigation plans and your group's schedule (constrained by the syllabus of course) would be important as well.
