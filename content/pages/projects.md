Project Requirements
--------------------

### Schedule and Deliverables

Each problem set of the term project is a 1-2 page of design summary of your important decisions/modeling/progress to date. We would expect to see detailed sketches, major equations and plots which demonstrate that you are on the right track. A short discussion of risks/mitigation plans and your group's schedule (constrained by the syllabus of course) would be important as well.

### Requirements

These are loose requirements meant to provide guidance. We may be flexible with them if you can justify…

We are not ultra-concerned with the rapidity with which you can drive your machine  
  
Your speed depends on your design. Determine what it needs to be to give you a reasonable level of accuracy. You'll have to justify your speed. Pay attention to thermal errors here…

### Budget

Each team will be allotted $200 to spend, but only if they can justify the need for the expenditure. Purchases for exploratory work/concept validation is permitted with proper feasibility justification. If you determine you need to order material, etc…. you must first contact Prof. Culpepper to obtain an Ok. We will not reimburse for expenses, all items must be purchased through Prof. Culpepper. When making a request, you should provide:

1.  Company name, phone number and address
2.  Part number
3.  Part description
4.  Cost and quantity

The TA is an invaluable resource for knowing where to find things you need!!! It is up to you to take into account delivery of the items you want/need.
